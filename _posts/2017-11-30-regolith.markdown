My partner and I designed this game using GameMaker Studio for our final project in Foundations of Game Design. We did all of our own collision detection, as we preferred writing our own code to the GameMaker GUI interface. The terrain is generated procedurally with a Voronoi Algorithm.

Tools used: GameMaker Studio
