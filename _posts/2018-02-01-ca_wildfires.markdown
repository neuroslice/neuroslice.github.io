My team and I created this Geomapped Data Visualization for our final project in CMPS 165, Data Programming and Visualization. It maps the history, size, agency in command, and other fire details of fires from the beginning of records in California until 2015. The geographical fire data was obtained from [Cal Fire](http://www.fire.ca.gov/). 

Tools used: HTML & CSS, JavaScript, D3.js, Topojson, JSON, QGIS.
