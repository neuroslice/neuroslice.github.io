	                        <p>Worked with a large research group that included seven interns, four scientists, and two developers. The long term goal was to introduce data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization into the workflow when running high-energy physics simulations. I worked on the data middleware between the simulation and analytics.</p>

	                            <li>Wrote a python script to select sections of the data and output them as multi-dimensional arrays.</li>
	                            <li>Evaluated the use of Conduit, a data exchange library developed at the lab, as a method for data exchange at simulation run time.</li>
